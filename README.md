# Pineapple-Studio

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/YER2VtW.png)

An attempt at a fully functioning ComputerCraft IDE. It aims to provide a better in-game coding experience than the existing ones, maybe even rivaling out-of-game editors. Unfortunately I had to abandon this project due to a lack of interest from the community.

## Getting Started

In order to start launch Pineapple Studio, you have to copy the content of this repository into a ComputerCraft device folder and execute `main.lua` by simply typing it into the ComputerCraft terminal.

## Features
Although this project is not even close to finished, it already contains some essential features, most notably:
  - Project management
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Custom 3rd party extensions
  - Custom theming system
  - Config files for preferences
